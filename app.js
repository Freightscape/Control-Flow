// EASY GOING 1 - Creating a for loop of 1 through 20
for (let i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
    console.log(i);
};
// started this with a 0 instead of a 1 changed it and console logged in chrome, got the right answer
// Note: Roberto Ramos helped with grasp of concepts on for loops prior to starting homework
// loading via git


// GET EVEN 2 - creating a loop that logs even numbers only up to 200
for (let i = 2; i < 202; i+=2){
    console.log(i);
};
// first tried by multiplying by "i*2", then by adding via "i+2", then went to google
// my answer was close found the solution here:

// You need to create a for loop that initializes the variable to 2, console.log the 
// variable to the screen, and add two to the variable on each iteration. Said another way: 
// starting at two, as long as i is less than 25, add two and log the new variable to the screen.
